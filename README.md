## üåê About Me

I am a full-stack web developer and computer science student at the University of Passo Fundo (UPF), currently based in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. I have a primary focus on frontend development, making clean and user-friendly websites. However, I also have experience building backend systems and APIs. In addition to my core focus, I enjoy learning about a wide range of topics, such as software automation, data science, and machine learning, and I look forward to apply those technologies in my projects to enhance functionality and user experience, as I strive to build sophisticated and efficient web solutions that stand out for their aesthetic value and technical robustness.
