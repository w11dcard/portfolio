## üåê About Me

I am a full-stack web developer and computer science student at the University of Passo Fundo (UPF), based in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

I specialize in creating user-friendly interfaces with a focus on elegant design and usability. I also have experience in back-end systems, integrating APIs and managing databases. I'm committed to staying updated on the industry trends and technologies while maintaining a foundation in more traditional tools. Beyond web development, I enjoy learning about topics such as software automation, data science, and machine learning.
